# Neural_Architecture_Search_with_-Auto_keras

Neural architecture search is a technique that automates the designing of neural networks for solving a particular problem. 

## Developing a Classifier Using Auto Keras
In this section, we will build a classifier on the the different data sets like Cifar100,Cifar10, MNIST,DTD,STL10 dataset because of the simplicity of the dataset as well as because the search takes a long time to run so the simpler the dataset the simpler it is to search for the best parameter.

## Requirments  

 ```
!pip install autokeras
```
